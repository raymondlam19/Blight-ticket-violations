    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: How can we increase blight ticket compliance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in answering this question is understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket. This is where predictive modeling comes in. For this assignment, your task is to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions: Probability that the corresponding blight ticket will be paid on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation metric: Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade will be based on the AUC score computed for your classifier. A model which with an AUCROC of 0.7 passes this assignment, over 0.75 will recieve full points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "Trains a model to predict blight ticket compliance in Detroit using train.csv. Using this model, return a series of length 61001 with the data being the probability that each corresponding ticket from test.csv will be paid, and the index being the ticket_id.\n",
